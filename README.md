## Important comments and known issues

- [`development`](https://github.com/henryzarza/leovegas-coding-assignment/tree/development) branch has all the latest changes
- Responsive in the `Header` needs to be fixed
- I added a scroll to the top of the page when the search input is clear but I'm not sure if is a good UX or not. [Code here](https://github.com/henryzarza/leovegas-coding-assignment/pull/7/files#diff-6efde9512356a2f5c3cc4c161365127d269413d13ae8fb43c3395c334981f447R14)
- [There is a known issue](https://github.com/henryzarza/leovegas-coding-assignment/pull/7/files#diff-6efde9512356a2f5c3cc4c161365127d269413d13ae8fb43c3395c334981f447R40) when the user goes to a page different than the home page, the input value is not being cleared, it could be fixed following my recommendation [here](https://github.com/henryzarza/leovegas-coding-assignment/pull/1/files#r1426674560), a good approach could be [this one](https://jasonwatmore.com/react-router-v6-listen-to-location-route-change-without-history-listen)
